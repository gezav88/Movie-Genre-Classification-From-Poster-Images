# Movie-Genre-Classification-From-Poster-Images
This project was developed for NCSU Masters degree for Neural Network Course

The main goal of this project is to validate if we are able to predict the movie genre just from Image posters, this project uses a Neural Network to perform that process. 

Data Info: 
Current dataset contains 39,515 JPEG images

Model Info:
